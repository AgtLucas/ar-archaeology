## continuum: ar - mixed reality - vr
<img class="stretch" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/Virtuality_Continuum_2.jpg"></img>

Note:
from your smartphone to disney world to the oculus & hololens


# Part 1 - Where we've been
## analogue AR
+ museum dioramas/overlays
+ landscape overlays, pois, interesting views
+ tromp l'oeil?

## history of ar as tech


## lost horizons - vr/ar in academia in 1990s
- or why it's difficult to get research grants that have 'AR' in the title


### Don't fear the hype cycle


# Part 2 - Where we're at
# ar: mostly in marketing
- notice the progression here: http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/26/ogmento-first-ar-gaming-startup-to-win-vc-funding/ to http://www.flybymedia.com/


## accessibility: which senses are 'augmented'?


### BiPs & Digital Phenomenology
- phenomenology is not a bad word. http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1352447/1/Eve_2012_Augmented_Phenomenology.pdf
- beyond digital dwelling http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0006/opar-2015-0006.xml?format=INT
- challenging heritage visualization http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0006/opar-2015-0006.xml?format=INT


### missing a trick: sound & AR


#### zombies, run!


#### [blindside](http://www.blindsidegame.com/)


#### [night terrors](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/night-terrors-augmented-reality-survival-horror)


#### [augmented audio](http://www.augmentedaudio.com/)


#### historical friction


#### voices recognition


#### http://www.recho.org/


# Part 3: How does this all work, anyway?

## Struture from Motion


## An example workflow

- my students' two AR pop-up books.
- (problem: SDKs changed, company acquired by Apple, shut'er down!)

- tools & apps
- hints & tips for 3d model making
- working with image targets
- things you might like to augment
  - vuforia: can augment images, objects, text; handles occlusion

----
- place-based AR - wikitude - MBIRA - ARIS
- ie, there's a smearing of game-based interaction - importance of game literacy to working with AR
- Aurasma - drag & drop image based AR, place based AR - drawbacks
- how hololens, google glass, that other startup whose name escapes me but everyone's excited about and which shines the images directly on your retina. Hold a unicorn in your hand etc).

----
- Caitlin Fisher's work: note the importance of sound in creating the ambiance/immersiveness in her art/work https://projeqt.com/caitlin/200-castles https://vimeo.com/51654422
  

# Part 4: Where we might go 

-video of that sandtable/gis thing
-heritage app game thing that Ethan emailed me (Also excursus into Techumseh Lies Here & ARGs)
-hololens demo of minecraft
  + on a related note, weep for the Kinect
  

## AR for archaeological research


### embodied GIS/phenomenology


### digital gabii 
- excavation, study of contexts


### 'excavation is digitization' 

+ http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/2042458215Y.0000000004


### [Project Mosul](http://projectmosul.org/)


### [Micropasts](http://research.micropasts.org/2014/06/13/3d-modelling-via-sfm/)


### AR in public archaeology
+ 'bringing impossible places to the public' http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0007/opar-2015-0007.xml?format=INT
+ HIST5702x & FYSM1405a, digitizing museum collections (thus the teaching potentials)
+ The Greeks app, Museum of History

# Conclusion:
## What's in it for you
- why you should bother
- the research potentials
- the public outreach potentials
- the rhetorical/tactical impact
- the problem of publishing [more about Digital Gabii]


# This afternoon:
+ Building an AR app in Unity3d with Vuforia
_or_
+ Building a location-based game (with sound!) in Twine
_or_
+ Making 3d models with 123d Catch; annotating & sharing them in Sketchfab (with Oculus or Cardboard viewing!)
