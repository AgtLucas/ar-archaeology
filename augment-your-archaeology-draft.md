# Augment your archaeology


- hook: whizbang. pompeii flipboards with acetate overlays?
- hook: stu eve's video with the barbarian invasion of cardboard model


## continuum: ar - mixed reality - vr


# Part 1 - Where we've been
## analogue AR
+ museum dioramas/overlays
+ landscape overlays, pois, interesting views
+ tromp l'oeil?

## history of ar as tech


## lost horizons - vr/ar in academia in 1990s
- or why it's difficult to get research grants that have 'AR' in the title


### Don't fear the hype cycle


# Part 2 - Where we're at
## ar in marketing


# accessibility: which senses are 'augmented'?


## BiPs & Digital Phenomenology
- phenomenology is not a bad word. http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1352447/1/Eve_2012_Augmented_Phenomenology.pdf

### [augmented audio](http://www.augmentedaudio.com/)

Part 3: Where we might go
#
# AR for archaeological research


## embodied GIS/phenomenology


## digital gabii 
- excavation, study of contexts


## 'excavation is digitization'

## [Project Mosul](http://projectmosul.org/)


## [Micropasts](http://research.micropasts.org/2014/06/13/3d-modelling-via-sfm/)


## AR in public archaeology
+ 'bringing impossible places to the public' http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0007/opar-2015-0007.xml?format=INT
+ HIST5702x & FYSM1405a, digitizing museum collections (thus the teaching potentials)
+ The Greeks app, Museum of History

# What's in it for you
- why you should bother
- the research potentials
- the public outreach potentials
- the rhetorical/tactical impact
- the problem of publishing [more about Digital Gabii]


# This afternoon:
+ Building an AR app in Unity3d with Vuforia
_or_
+ Building a location-based game (with sound!) in Twine
_or_
+ Making 3d models with 123d Catch; annotating & sharing them in Sketchfab (with Oculus or Cardboard viewing!)
