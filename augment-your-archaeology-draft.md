# Augment your archaeology
<small> Follow along on your own device at http://j.mp/ar-arch</small>

Note:
Why bother with AR? Ain't it just a gimmick? Make a Pratchett allusion - Tiffany Aching- Open your eyes, then open them again?


## the archaeological eye

Note:
We've always been augmenting reality. But maybe we could make things a bit more... awesome. image: http://www.dayofarchaeology.com/cakes-cottages-and-manky-bones/

...consider the Museum Diorama...

Note:
Stu Eve app. This video continues to blow me away. No AR app I've seen in the intervening years comes as close.

## the continuum

Note:
from your smartphone to disney world to the oculus & hololens. archaeologists have always been working along this continuum.


## Who bothers with AR?

Note: 
mostly advertising world - but clearly Microsoft, Google, & others are making *huge* bets here. - notice the progression here: http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/26/ogmento-first-ar-gaming-startup-to-win-vc-funding/ to http://www.flybymedia.com/

### Ok, so much for the hype.
# _Nihil novi sub sole_
Note: this ends the intro; having looked at the geewhiz aspects, let's turn to the things that have been constant


## analogue AR
Flipbooks

Wall paintings

## analogue VR

Stereoscopes

...and no doubt you can think of more examples...


## thing is, we were promised this

### What gets augmented, anyway? 
## privileging the visual

Note: 
Something about the gaze etc


## BiPs & Digital Phenomenology
- phenomenology is not a bad word. http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1352447/1/Eve_2012_Augmented_Phenomenology.pdf
- beyond digital dwelling http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0006/opar-2015-0006.xml?format=INT
- challenging heritage visualization http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0006/opar-2015-0006.xml?format=INT


## missing a trick: sound & AR
+ sound is haptic
+ sound requires active attention
+ sound is spatialized
+ can use it to deliberately play with BiPs

# AR in archaeological research


### embodied GIS/phenomenology


### digital gabii 
- excavation, study of contexts


### 'excavation is digitization' 

+ http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/2042458215Y.0000000004


### [Project Mosul](http://projectmosul.org/)


### [Micropasts](http://research.micropasts.org/2014/06/13/3d-modelling-via-sfm/)


### AR in public archaeology
+ 'bringing impossible places to the public' http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/opar.2014.1.issue-1/opar-2015-0007/opar-2015-0007.xml?format=INT
+ HIST5702x & FYSM1405a, digitizing museum collections (thus the teaching potentials)
+ The Greeks app, Museum of History
-video of that sandtable/gis thing
-heritage app game thing that Ethan emailed me (Also excursus into Techumseh Lies Here & ARGs)



# Conclusion:
## What's in it for you
- why you should bother
- the research potentials
- the public outreach potentials
- the rhetorical/tactical impact
- the problem of publishing [more about Digital Gabii]


# This afternoon:
+ Building an AR app in Unity3d with Vuforia
_or_
+ Building a location-based game (with sound!) in Twine
_or_
+ Making 3d models with 123d Catch; annotating & sharing them in Sketchfab (with Oculus or Cardboard viewing!)
