## Struture from Motion


## An example workflow

- my students' two AR pop-up books.
- (problem: SDKs changed, company acquired by Apple, shut'er down!)

- tools & apps
- hints & tips for 3d model making
- working with image targets
- things you might like to augment
  - vuforia: can augment images, objects, text; handles occlusion

----
- place-based AR - wikitude - MBIRA - ARIS
- ie, there's a smearing of game-based interaction - importance of game literacy to working with AR
- Aurasma - drag & drop image based AR, place based AR - drawbacks
- how hololens, google glass, that other startup whose name escapes me but everyone's excited about and which shines the images directly on your retina. Hold a unicorn in your hand etc).
