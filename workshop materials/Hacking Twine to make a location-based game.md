# Low friction Augmented Reality using Twine

I call this _low friction_ because

1. the app for building this works rather like a text-editor
2. the coding is minimal
3. the app itself lives as a webpage and so is fairly accessible no matter what device the user has (provided they have geolocation abilities, obviously)

## Ingredients
+ [Twinery 2](http://twinery.org/) (which you can run as an executable or within your browser*)
+ Server space to upload your final html to (gh-pages works; public dropbox works if you still have that feature; [philome.la](http://philome.la/) if you don't want to futz with all of that.)
