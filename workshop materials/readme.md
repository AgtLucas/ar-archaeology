-----
My intention in this workshop is to show you enough of the nuts-and-bolts so that you can build or remix into your own archaeological application or use. 

Feel free to fork this repo. If you run into trouble, if something is unclear or doesn't work, please leave a note under [issues](issues).

I look forward to seeing what you get up to!
