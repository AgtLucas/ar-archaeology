# Installing and Using VSFM 
## from the command line

The [VSFM package](http://ccwu.me/vsfm/) is not easy to install or work with. However, there is a (relatively) easy way to use it as a 'container' - that is, a virtual machine set up just for image processing and point cloud extraction etc from the images. Ryan Baumann from the [Duke Collaboratory for Classics Computing](https://blogs.library.duke.edu/dcthree/) has [put all of the necessary bits-and-bobs together to run VSFM this way](http://ryanfb.github.io/etc/2015/01/13/docker_for_visualsfm.html).
